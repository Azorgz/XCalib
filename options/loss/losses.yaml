### Loss configuration file.
### Each loss can be activated or deactivated at a given epoch.
# The args are:
#   weight: weighting factor for the loss
#   disable_after: epoch after which the loss is deactivated (null means never - must be between [0 1] * epochs_total)
#   enable_after: epoch after which the loss is activated
### If a loss is deactivated, it will not be computed at all

### Optical Flow loss for coarse prepositioning (OFF after epochs_total / 2 epochs).
flow:
  weight: 2.
  disable_after : null
  enable_after: 0


### Photometric loss for fine-tuning (always ON).
# Several metrics can be combined, each having its own weighting factor.
image:
    weight: 1.0
    disable_after: null
    enable_after: 0
    losses:
      NEC:
        weight: 1.0
### Losses for ablation study
#      GC:
#        weight: 1.0
      SSIM:
        weight: 0.50
#      RMSE:
#          weight: 1.0
#      PSNR:
#          weight: 1.0
#      NCC:
#          weight: 1.0


#### Regularization term to avoid large motions drift (always ON).
reg:
    weight: 2.0
    disable_after: null
    enable_after: 0
